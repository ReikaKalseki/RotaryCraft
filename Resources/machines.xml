	<bedrockbreaker>
		<desc>
			The bedrock breaker will, when sufficiently powered, gradually grind away at the bedrock blocks in front of it and move on to the next block. When each block is consumed, it will expel some bedrock dust, which can be used to make the highest tier of tools or shafts and gears - bedrock. This machine's operational speed goes up as the input speed does. This machine will NOT break the bedrock at layer 0.

	<fermenter>
		<desc>
			The fermenter is how you produce the ethanol for the engines that require it. To make yeast, place sugar in the top slot, and dirt on the bottom. To make sludge, put yeast on top and plant matter on the bottom. Put that in a furnace, and you will get crystals of ethanol. This machine's operational speed rises as the input speed does. This machine is temperature-sensitive, and very low or high temperatures will slow it down or even kill the yeast. To automate this machine, use redstone to choose the target production item (displayed at the top-right of the GUI). The middle GUI slot is in fact a water gauge, not an item slot.

	</fermenter>
	<grinder>
		<desc>
			The grinder does exactly what its name suggests - it grinds things. Stone to cobblestone, cobble to gravel, gravel to sand, that sort of thing. It also plays a critical role in the lubrication of gearboxes - it grinds the canola seeds into an oil usable as lubricant. This machine's operational speed goes up as the input speed does.

	</grinder>
	<floodlight>
		<desc>
			The floodlight creates a beam of light that illuminates everything in its path until blocked by an opaque, solid block. Perfect for lighting up large spaces where point-source light sources like torches will simply not cut it.

		</note>
	</floodlight>
	<heatray>
		<desc>
			One of the most powerful and expensive of the machines, the heat ray creates a beam of fiery death and destruction for as long as its range allows. While it is hard to supply enough power to turn the thing on, let alone unlock some of its more powerful capabilities, it, fully powered, is capable of burning down a biome kilometers away if you let it. Extra power to this machine, in addition to increasing range, also increases the range and strength of its ability to melt rock, light TNT...

	</heatray>
	<borer>
		<desc>
			The boring machine is rather interesting. It will dig tunnels in the direction it is facing for as long as you like. With the GUI, you can control the tunnel shape, and control the item drops. Harder materials require more power and torque to dig - %dW per hardness points of the blocks in front of it, and up to %d Nm of torque per block to cut through the harder materials. The borer will ensure that the tunnel roof does not collapse by replacing sand and gravel. Rumor has it that certain underground mazes found in a mythical forest are easily conquered with this machine, though the hard stone makes for a high torque requirement.

	</borer>
	<piledriver>
		<desc>
			The pile driver repeatedly impacts the ground to break it apart, digging a deep, narrow shaft. This shaft will go through any liquids in its path, and will go through everything but bedrock. Multiple impacts are required to break some harder materials, and the vibration will dislodge things like paintings, uproot saplings, and disorient players. Beware: Being in the path of the mining pile will end exactly as you may imagine. This machine's power requirements go up the deeper it digs - %dW per meter depth.

	<aerosolizer>
		<desc>
			The potion aerosolizer has nine internal tanks which can store up to 64 bottles of potion each. These effects are dispersed through the entire room the machine is in, and applied to all entities within. Filling more than one slot with the same potion type will result in upgraded effects.
		</desc>

		</note>
	</aerosolizer>
	<lightbridge>
		<desc>
			This machine will, when its enormous power requirement is satisfied, emit a beam of solid, tangible light which can be walked upon and will support any mass placed on it. Nothing can destroy this beam, but it will be blocked by any non-air block. Note that it requires bright light above it - or a view of the sky - in order to be able to make the beam.
		</desc>
		<note>
			Required Power: %dW for full range, or %dW per meter
			Power Input: Back
		</note>
	</lightbridge>
	<extractor>
		<desc>
			The extractor is used to get more material out of ore. First, it grinds ore to dust, then mixes it with water to form a slurry, then presses that slurry through a filter to obtain a liquid solution, then burns the result to obtain ore flakes. These flakes can be smelted in a furnace to obtain a unit of the ore's material. Each stage in the extractor has at least a 50%% chance of doubling the output. The machine's requirements are complex and vary from stage to stage, but a supply of water and %d Nm of torque at %d rad/s will run all four stages.

			Notes: Stages 2 and 3 require a water supply; can be upgraded with a bedrock drill
		</note>
	</extractor>
	<pulsejet>
		<desc>
			The pulse jet is a powerful furnace. While it will not smelt the ordinary recipes, it will melt obsidian into glass that is immune to TNT, melt armor and tools back into ingots, and make steel more efficiently than a standard furnace. It will get VERY hot, and will ignite nearby flammable materials - keeping it cooled with water is a necessity. While there is no minimum power requirement, the jet requires high shaft speeds. The pulse jet consumes jet fuel to operate, and a rather large amount of it. This machine receives power from below.

			Required Speed: %d rad/s
			Power Input: Bottom
			Max Temperature: %dC
		</note>
	</pulsejet>
	<pump>
		<desc>
			The pump will, when provided with power, will suck up liquids from the surrounding area and pump them into pipes, for transport to a machine that can use it. Water is often used as coolant, while lava is more often pumped to a reservoir for convenient access or as fuel to some engines.
		</desc>
		<note>
			Required Power: %d W
			Required Torque: %d Nm
			Power Input: Front or Back
		</note>
	</pump>
	<reservoir>
		<desc>
			The reservoir is simply a tank for storing any liquid, with a maximum capacity of %d cubic meters (buckets). It can be right-clicked with a bucket to add or remove liquid, and if it is full of water, glass bottles can be filled from it. Additionally, they can be linked horizontally to form large vats, and covered with glass panes.
		</desc>
		<note>
			Capacity: %d m^3 per block
		</note>
	</reservoir>
	<fan>
		<desc>
			The fan emits a stream of air that will push entities around. With greater input power, heavier entities can be moved, and all entities will accelerate faster. A minimum of %dW of power is required, and power levels greater than %dW of power will have no increased effect due to airflow limitations. The fan, at higher speeds, can also be used to uproot crops to harvest them, and to put out - or spread - fires.
		</desc>
		<note>
			Required Power: %dW
			Range = 8+(Power-MINPOWER)/%d m
			Power Input: Back
			Harvesting Speed: %d rad/s
			Fire Extinguish Speed: %d rad/s
			Can be upgraded with a diffuser to increase AOE, but this reduces efficiency 50%%
		</note>
	</fan>
	<compactor>
		<desc>
			The compactor is capable of compressing coal until it becomes anthracite, then prismane, then lonsdaleite, then diamond. Each stage will require four of the input items per unit output. All steps require enormous pressures of %dkPa and temperatures of greater than %dC to take place. The compactor will gradually heat or cool depending on its surroundings, and pressure is built up by applying high torques.

	<autobreeder>
		<desc>
			The auto-breeder will lure in animals, and when they get close, feed them until they feel like breeding. With this machine, you can quickly amass large herds. Each animal has its own desired food item; without that item, the machine will fail to attract or feed the animal. Wolves, for example, particularly like raw pork. The food item will be consumed when the animal enters breeding mode.

			Power Input: Bottom
		</note>
	</autobreeder>
	<baitbox>
		<desc>
			The bait box will attract or repel mobs of all kinds, provided it contains the appropriate items to do so. For example, Endermen are attracted by grass blocks and the opportunity to take them, but are repelled by the faces on soul sand staring back at them. These items are not consumed. It can also incubate eggs if gently heated.

	</baitbox>
	<firework>
		<desc>
			The firework machine will, when given the appropriate ingredients with which to make fireworks, craft random fireworks out of the possible recipes and launch them automatically. When given pre-made firework stars, it will use those preferentially. With excess power input, the machine is capable of conserving ingredients and thus getting far more than one firework out of the same amount of ingredients.

	</firework>
	<fractionator>
		<desc>
			The fractionator distills various items and refines them into jet fuel for use in some of the engines and machines. Jet fuel requires tar, netherrack dust, coal, blaze powder, ethanol, and magma cream. Additionally, ghast tears are used as a solvent, but are not consumed like the other items. Fuel lines connect only to the top of this machine.

	</fractionator>
	<gpr>
		<desc>
			The Ground-Penetrating Radar is capable of reading the densities and other properties of the blocks below it, and from that determining what blocks lie below. This allows it to draw a cross-sectional map of caves, underground structures, and other materials. Larger power inputs will give it a wider field of view, topping out at 82 blocks wide.

	<heater>
		<desc>
			Tired of blowing up your compactors and other machines by overheating them? The heater will heat itself to a temperature you specify, and when placed below a machine, will warm it to a temperature near its own. The heater will consume any fuel that the standard furnace can, with stronger fuels providing more heat, up to 800C from one lava bucket.

	<playerdetector>
		<desc>
			The player detector does exactly what its name implies - when a player comes within its configurable range, it will emit a redstone signal. The maximum range is determined by the power input, and the reaction time of the detector - the delay between a player entering a range and the signal output - is dependent on the speed input.

			Required Power: %dW
			Min Delay: %d-40*log_2(Speed)
			Power Input: Spawner Block
		</note>
	</spawnercontroller>
	<sprinkler>
		<desc>
			The sprinkler will, when supplied with water, spray it out on the blocks below, watering crops and speeding up their growth, hydrating farmland, and extinguishing fires. Higher water pressures - created by larger power inputs to the pumps - result in increased range.
		</desc>
		<note>
			Range: Water Pressure/80
		</note>
	</sprinkler>
	<vacuum>
		<desc>
			The item vacuum draws items and XP orbs towards it, and will absorb them into its internal storage when they get close. To extract the stored XP, right-click it with a screwdriver while sneaking. The item vacuum can also suck items from inventories horizontally adjacent to it (except other vacuums).

			Required Power: %dW
			Required Torque: %d Nm
			Power Input: Back
		</note>
	</woodcutter>
	<ecu>
		<desc>
			The engine controller can throttle down the fuel-powered engines. When throttled down, they output their usual torque, but at a fraction of the speed. The benefit of this is that they consume fuel more slowly; slower speeds have greater efficiencies than faster ones, though turbine engines do not see as large a benefit. Modes are changed by right-clicking the ECU with a screwdriver. The ECU can also accept a redstone input, which will shut the engine down entirely.

	</ecu>
	<mobradar>
		<desc>
			The mob radar can detect mobs in a large radius around it, and is unobstructed by blocks in the way. It will display their positions on the NSEW plane, signified with the appropriate icon. If you have a motion tracker in your inventory, the radar will also render a HUD of sorts to alert you to mob positions near you.

		<note>
			Maximum energy acheivable is proportional to torque input
		</note>
	</winder>
	<tntcannon>
		<desc>
			The TNT cannon fires primed TNT either with a given velocity (specified by speed, launch angle, and compass heading), or to a specific target coordinate. It requires a continuous supply of TNT to continue operation. It requires higher torques to fire at steeper angles, more speed to fire faster projectiles, and more power to reach farther targets.

	</tntcannon>
	<sonicweapon>
		<desc>
			The sonic weapon is a ranged defense weapon designed to protect against hostile mobs and players. At higher and higher volumes (made possible by higher input torques), it can cause more and more debilitating effects on those in its effect radius, from confusion to blindness to drowning to death. This machine follows the inverse-square law, and thus the sound intensity and the severity of its effects decrease accordingly.

	<blastfurnace>
		<desc>
			The blast furnace is the main way to make steel. Simply supply carbon (in the form of coal or coke) at the left, gunpowder at the bottom-left, sand in the top-left, and fill any or all of the middle nine slots with iron ingots. Heat the machine to %dC to start the alloying process. The machine will operate more efficiently with coke and with more slots full of iron. The coal is not fuel - an external heat source is required. This machine is also used to make bedrock ingots. To make that, put 4 bedrock dust in the left, one steel ingot in the top-left of the grid, and heat the machine to %dC.
		</desc>
		<note>
			Steel Requirements: Coal/coke in left slot, gunpowder in bottom-left, sand in top-left, iron in middle slots

			Bonuses: Chance increases as the number of filled slots rises, max 50 percent
			Max bonus size: Increases as the number of filled slots rises, max 100 percent

			XP per steel ingot: %.2f

	</blastfurnace>
	<forcefield>
		<desc>
			The force field emits a solid sphere of energy that repels all hostile mobs and projectiles. Note that it is only solid in one direction - threats may leave but cannot re-enter. However, due to the large magnetic field, arrows will be diverted even if launched from inside the sphere. This machine needs a clear view above it equal to the selected radius.

	<musicbox>
		<desc>
			The music box is essentially an integrated noteblock circuit. Simply program it with music - either using one of the demo tracks or by writing your own, and give it power to run the music. A redstone pulse will cycle the music once; for looping music, use shaft power.

	</projector>
	<railgun>
		<desc>
			The railgun is a very powerful defence weapon. It uses strong magnetic fields to accelerate heavy metallic ammunition at the target, dealing very large amounts of damage. Note that more massive projectiles deal much more damage, and can destroy large areas of terrain. The railgun will automatically target the nearest visible mob; for maximum efficiency, mount it where it has a clear view of the surrounding area. You may also invert the railgun to target below itself rather than above.

	<cavescanner>
		<desc>
			The cave scanner functions much like a laser 3D scanner. It sends pulses into the ground and can detect the interface between air and other blocks, which it will render in the world. This allows you to map caves from the surface. Its field of view is 16 blocks by default, and can be moved around by right-clicking the block. Right-click will push it in the direction you are looking, and shift-right-clicking will push it in the opposite direction you are looking. Caves are color coded based on depth.

		</note>
	</smokedetector>
	<igniter>
		<desc>
			The firestarter allows you to ignite flammable materials in a large radius, and is therefore very effective at clearing areas in forests or tall grass. Due to its ability to ignite creatures, it can also serve as a powerful, if rather dangerous, form of defence.

	<freezegun>
		<desc>
			The freeze gun is a nonlethal defence weapon. It automatically targets threats, and will freeze them in a block of ice, completely immobilizing them without causing them other harm. Ice is more effective ammunition than snowballs. Like the Railgun, this machine can be oriented upside-down and is most effective with a clear view of the surroundings. Note that frozen mobs can still attack if approached.

		<desc>
			The containment field is complementary to the Force Field - while that keeps things out, this keeps them in. Note that hostile mobs which fire projectiles, like Skeletons and the Wither, can still hit targets outside the field without leaving it themselves. This machine needs a clear view above it equal to the selected radius.

	<friction>
		<desc>
			The friction heater is a tool to warm up a standard furnace without fuel. Higher torques and speeds mean higher temperatures, but beware: spend too long at high temperatures and you can melt the furnace entirely. Also of note is that high temperatures can speed up the furnace operation. A hot furnace is also the only way to smelt tungsten flakes into tungsten ingots. Note that while temperature is ultimately a function of input power, matching the torque and speed will improve efficiency.

			The terraformer is used to convert biomes into each other. Note that it can only convert between similar biomes - so radical changes may require multiple steps - and each stage is likely to consume a great deal of liquid and items. Give this machine a diamond and it can even mimic the world-generation of the target biome.

			The EMP, when fired, will permanently disable all nearby vulnerable machines. Things like shafts are immune due to lacking any electronic or redstone parts, nor any intelligence, but anything even remotely more complex, such as a spawner, an engine, or a battery box will be destroyed. Rumor has it that this machine's blast is so powerful that it can even upset the balance of the invisible magic "nodes" said to exist in the world.

			Fuel lines carry ethanol or jet fuel to the engines and furnaces that require it. Once connected to a source, they will automatically start to fill themselves from it, and if connected to a target, will automatically empty themselves into it. They have a very high capacity, so caution is recommended when breaking them, to avoid destroying large quantities of stored fuel.

			The pneumatic item pump is used to rapidly transfer items between inventories. If an item pump has an inventory behind it, it will check in front of it for a valid receiving inventory. If it finds another pump, it follows that pump's frontal direction and repeats the process. This system allows you to transport items across any distance nearly instantly. The pump can transfer one item per tick per kW of input power; therefore, to transfer entire stacks, supply 65kW of power. More power will transfer multiple stacks, as there is no upper limit on the transfer rate.

It has three modes: In autonomous mode, it continuously crafts as long as it has ingredients to do so; in request mode, it will craft one cycle of the requested items and then sit idle. It can read any inventory above it or it can draw from an Applied Energistics network for its ingredient supply. This machine can store 18 patterns, and thus can craft 18 recipes in parallel. Its third mode, sustain, ensures a certain amount of a given item remains in the ME system.
