			You have already made goggles which allow you to see the auras and nodes permeating the world, but there is a problem. Not only do those goggles provide little protection, but they are flimsy and can rather easily be destroyed when you get hurt. Knowing that you also have access to an unbreakable helmet made of bedrock, the hardest material known, you hit upon the idea of combining the two. The bedrock is tough and cannot be reshaped except in a Blast Furnace, a machine which does not support any sort of magical interaction, so you will be forced to infuse the magic powers of the thaumometers into the helmet through another means, perhaps binding it with quicksilver and salis mundus.
